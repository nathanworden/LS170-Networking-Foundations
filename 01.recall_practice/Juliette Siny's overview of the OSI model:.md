Juliette Siny's overview of the OSI model:

There are 7 layers to the OSI model.

Starting with the physical layer. Cabers, wifi, optcal wire. 

Up a notch- the datalink layer. Between your device and the switch. 

Network layer. Technically the internet layer. The layer where there are routers and where your IP address is useful. The communication going literally, physically to the end of the world. IP address are logical in nature. IP address will route information in the right direction even though it doesn't know where.

Transport Layer - How to make the internet reliable

Session - How your computer and the server open a sesson. Whenver you are interacting with a website. 

Presentation - The conversion of the request within your operating system. 

Application - Can be anything. Your browser, video chat, spotify, anything that is connected to the internet and requires internet connections. If your computer is connected to a server.
