# HTTP Book

[toc]

## Background

- HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

- HTTP is a system of rules, a protocol, that serve as a link between applications and the transfer of hypertext documents. Stated differently, it's an agreement, or message format, of how machines communicate with each other.

- HTTP follows a simple model where a client maeks a request to a server and waits for a response.

- An IP Address acts as the identifer for a device or server, and can contain hundreds or thousands of ports, each used for a different communication purpose to that device or server.
- DNS - Domain Name System
- DNS - a distributed database which translates IP address names to human readable names.
- Your typical interaction with the Internet starts with a web browser when you:
  1. Enter an address like http://www.google.com into your web browser.
  2. Your request is sent to your device's network interface. (Your Internet Service Provider).
  3. The request goes over the Internet where a search for google begins. Behind the scenes, http://www.google.com is simpy a human-friendly name that represents an IP Address associated with a remote computer or server.
  4. The remote server accepts the request and sends a response over the Internet to your network interface which hands it to your browser.
- When your browser issues a request, it's simply sending some text to an IP address.
- Statelessness - When each request/response pair is completley independent of the previous one.

## What is a URL?

- URL - Uniform Resource Locator
- The URL is comprised of several components:
  - The scheme `http`
  - The host `www.example.com` 
  - The port `:88`
  - The path `/home/`
  - The query string `?item=book`

- URLs are designed to accept only certain characters in the standard 128-character ASCII character set.
